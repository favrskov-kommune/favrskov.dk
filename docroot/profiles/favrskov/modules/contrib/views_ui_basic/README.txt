Views UI: Edit Basic Settings
=============================

http://drupal.org/project/views_ui_basic

"Views UI: Edit Basic Settings" places edit tabs on Views pages, similar to node 
pages, and allows users with the correct permission to modify their header, 
footer, title, empty text, or number of items to display. This module also 
provides a separate interface that displays a list of views. All Views are 
defined by the admin, so certain Views can be excluded.

======
How-To
======
- To define which views to display, visit "Structure" --> "Views" -->
  "Editable basic settings" 
- Make sure the user role has the "edit views basic settings" permission.

Please note fields will automatically use the "override" Views setting on save,
leaving the "default" value unmodified.
