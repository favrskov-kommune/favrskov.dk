# Molecules
* Combination of both particles and molecules
* Like particles they shouldnt have any dependencies
* Combined UI that the user can interact with
* All actions are mutable

### Generate
1. To allow generating components write: `npm link` in the root dir. (only have to do it once after 'npm install')
2. Run
```
createComponent -t m -n my-molecule
```
